# Do Androids Draw of Electric Sheep?

## Introduction
As you can see, the project was inspired by a science fiction novel: Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? For this project, I used the quick draw dataset from google, which has sketches drawn by different people from all over the world. I wanted to use GAN to allow the AI to draw its own sheep.

## Dataset and reference

Dataset: https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data
Reference: https://github.com/HuiiJi/GAN_.py/tree/main

## Working Process

Firstly, this dataset was not in the image format or csv format that I was familiar with, so I formatted him and stored him in a folder in png format.
